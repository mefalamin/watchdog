# watchdog

Watchdog is an Arduino Uno microcontroller based system which was developed by me for my Microcontroller System Design lab.It can detect the 
leakage of methane gas from stove and raise an alarm.Also it can send a notification to your android phone through bluetooth which is paired and connected always.

The hardare modules and software used in this project development are listing below:
